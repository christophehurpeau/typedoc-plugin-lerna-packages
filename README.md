## @chrp/typedoc-plugin-lerna-packages

Fork of [typedoc-plugin-lerna-packages](https://github.com/marcj/typedoc-plugin-lerna-packages)

A plugin for [Typedoc](http://typedoc.org) that groups all Lerna packages
into own TS module. Normally Typedoc handles each file as a module, this
isn't correct for lerna packages, as each package should be treated as
a module. This plugins handles that. Also if you have a README.md in your
package folder, it will be used as comment for that module.

Example Demo: https://marshal.marcj.dev/

Example source code: https://github.com/marcj/marshal.ts

Just install it and type `typedoc`:

```bash
npm i -D typedoc-plugin-lerna-packages typedoc
# yarn add -D typedoc-plugin-lerna-packages typedoc

npx typedoc
# yarn typedoc
```

Example `typedoc.js` in your root folder

```js
module.exports = {
  mode: "modules",
  out: "docs",
  exclude: ["**/node_modules/**", "**/*.spec.ts"],
  name: "MY NAME",
  excludePrivate: true,
};
```

## Options

In `typedoc.js` you can add following extra config values to change the behavior of this plugin.

```js
module.exports = {
  //...

  //exclude packages from being generated
  lernaExclude: ["@vendor/integration-tests", "@vendor/examples"],
};
```

### Development

When you work on this package you should link to it in a other lerna repo,
and then execute following command to make generation working:

```
rm -rf docs && NODE_PRESERVE_SYMLINKS=1 ./node_modules/.bin/typedoc
```
